# Mobilized Construction - IoT sensor device for crowd sourcing Road Roughness data

## Background
Mobilized Construction is an infrastructure technology company that has the vision to revolutionize the way road infrastructure is being maintained in Subsaharan Africa. 
We have built software that is able to utilize the accelerometer in a modern smartphone to pick up vibrations in cars and through an algorithm able to calculate what's called the International Road Roughness Index. 
By digitizing the data collection we have taken one step closer to providing Kenyan governments with real time data for road maintenance planning. 

Our main obstacle to scaling our innovation is our reliance on smartphones, 
as these can be misappropriated and "lost" they are not ideal for handing out and crowdsourcing data from impoverished communities. 
We need assistance to build a low-cost IoT device that we can hand out to local Kenyans increase our data collection and even provide data updates in real time. 


## Project Idea(s)
An Iot sensor device for crowd sourcing Road Roughness data

The IoT device needs to:
- Have the ability to pick up data from an accelerometer and a GPS,
- Store it on a small local storage
- Transmit the data in bundles via a low cost/low power solution
- Be able to run for 6+ months without charging, the longer the better. You have creative freedom to utilize solar, kinetic energy like in watches or simply integrating into the car engine.


## Technology
This project might be addressed with 

- embedded programming, 
- arduino, 
- android

but other options are possible and welcome.
