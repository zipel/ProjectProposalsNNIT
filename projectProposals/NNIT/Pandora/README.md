# Pandora

## Background
Bang & Olufsen manufactures a highly distinctive and exclusive range of
televisions, music systems, loudspeakers, telephones, and multimedia products
that combine technological excellence with emotional appeal.

## Project Idea(s)

### 1. Wearing feelings
Pandora wants to digitalize human-jewelery interaction.
The digitalization of jewelry will include sensors such as a heart rate and a
galvanic sensor which will give information about the consumers feeling and
change its state (color,shape), such as: a happy consumer will have the jewelry
color changed to green.

#### Technology
- Wearables
- Embedded Programming
- Context Awareness

### 2. Feeling the wearing
Pandora wants to digitalize human-jewelery interaction.
The digitalization of jewelry will include sensors that let the jewelry change
its state (color, shape) based on the average palette of the consumers clothes.
The customization of state should also be possible by an external app and could
use for example the phone camera to detect the average color.

#### 2.1 Use Case
Pandora provides an app together with their latest jewelry. The app is
capable to suggest the color the jewelry has to have based on the customer wish
or state.

#### 2.2 Scenario:
A customer wear a blue jewelry. Open the Pandora app and take a photo of the
dress the customer want to have. The jewelry change its color to be the average
palette (e.g., yellow) of the customer dress.

#### Technology
- Wearables
- Embedded Programming
- Computer Vision
