# Coop

## Background
Coop Danmark A/S is Denmark's leading consumer goods retailer. Coop operates
the retail chains Kvickly, SuperBrugsen, Dagli’Brugsen, Coop.dk Shopping,
Coop.dk MAD and the subsidiaries Fakta A/S and Irma A/S.

Coop Danmark and the subsidiaries have an annual turnover of approximately DKK
50 billion, and in total more than  36,000 employees. Coop has no stock
holders, instead we are owned by our 1.6 million members. Members can
participate in decision making, both at the level of the local retail store and
nationally in electing the board of directors at the 'Landsråd' (national
council).

## Project Idea(s)

### 1. Predictive Equipment Maintenance
Coop wants to build a predictive equipment maintenance system to
manage energy, predict equipment failure or detect other
issues. For example, every grocery store has a lot of complex equipment
(e.g., refrigeration units). When these units are instrumented with
sensors, we can predict maintenance issues that might affect power
consumption or monitor temperature fluctuations to ensure food safety.

#### Technology
- Embedded Programming
- Data visualisation
- Data analysis, machine learning

### 2. Consumer Interaction in Store
Coop is planning to create a new engaging experience for in-store customers.
Coop wants to integrate their warehouse with augumented
reality capability in order to give a different experience when buying
products. The system could for example tell the history, manufacturing
informations or nutritional values for each product.

#### 2.1 Use Case
Coop has made their shelves to be interactive using augmented
reality. In particular the fresh food shelves. 

#### 2.2 Scenario
A Customer is willing to buy fish (based on the customers habits: eat fish
every Friday/records her diet via a molecular scanner).  
The fishes are tagged.  
RFID tag on captured fish to note the fish location.  
RFID tag notes the date of catch.  
RFID tag the temperature during transit.  
RFID tag ensure the fish is fresh at checkout.  
All the above information are showed via augmented reality to the customer.

#### Technology
- Computer Vision
- Embedded Programming
- iOS/Android Programming

### 3. Targeted Advertising
Coop is planning to create a new engaging experience when consumers are not in
the shop. Coop wants to integrate their life, health need, environmental
variable and habits to their shopping needs. A gluten-free, lactose free
consumer may want to get only offering about their available products or a list
of weekly food-menu could help to find the best offering products.

#### Technology
- Data analytics
- Data mining
