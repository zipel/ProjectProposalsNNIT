# Arla

## Background
Arla Foods is an international cooperative based in Viby, Denmark, and the
largest producer of dairy products in Scandinavia. Arla Foods was formed as the
result of a merger between the Swedish dairy cooperative Arla and the Danish
dairy company MD Foods on 17 April 2000. Arla Foods has three major brands:
Arla, Lurpak and Castello cheeses that are sold worldwide. The Arla Brand is
both a co-operative brand and a brand across all product categories. The Lurpak
brand of butter and spreads is owned by the Danish Dairy Board, and Castello is
a cheese brand including blue cheese and yellow cheeses. The name Arla derives
from the same word as the English word "early" and is an archaic Swedish term
for "early (in the morning)". Arla Foods is the fourth largest dairy company in
the world with respect to milk volume, seventh with respect to turnover. At the
start of 2016, 12,500 farmers across Western Europe and Scandinavia owned the
cooperative.

## Project Idea(s)

### 1. Proved Quality
Customers are concerned with the quality and origin of their diary products.
Arla wants to add the capability to prove the quality of their
products using IoT. Final customers then might use their smartphones
to trace back products they pick up in a supermarket by e.g., using augmented reality.

#### 1.1 Use Case
Arla is planning to tag the entire milk production process, from the food the
cow is eating until is delivered to the consumer giving information in the form
of a quality score.

#### 1.2 Scenario
The consumer is buying an Arla product and using her smartphone and augmented reality is tracking
back the final product. The customer is able to see the cows location, the food
eaten by the cow, the production site and the quality score based on all the
production characteristics.
