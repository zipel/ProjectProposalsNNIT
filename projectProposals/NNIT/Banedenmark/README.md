# Banedanmark

## Background
Banedanmark (previously Banestyrelsen) is a Danish company responsible for
maintenance and traffic control of most of the Danish railway network. Branched
off from DSB as a government agency in 1997. From 2004 to 2010 Banedanmark was
a state-owned company under the Danish Ministry of Transport. In 2010
Banedanmark once again became a government agency under the Danish Ministry of
Transport.

## Project Idea(s)

### 1. Security and Maintenance
Today’s maintenance and security are mainly a responsibility of specialists which walk
along the railways and take pictures or videos of the environment for reporting
and for maintenance/security purposes. This current approach does not scale well, is expensive,
slow and error prone.
The goal of this project is to automate this maintenance process using IoT to detected failure or anomalies.
For example, Banedenmark is considering LIDAR technologies to map the
railways environment/surrounding and map afterwards those detection in a 3D
tool(Unity3D), being notified if necessary. 

#### 1.1 Use Case
A sentinel train is sent to a specific track. The sentinel train has image
recording capability and in real time is streaming captured information to a
central system which is analyzing the collected information and is notifying
specific responsible for actions to do.

#### 1.2 Scenario
A tree is growing inside the railway. The sentinel train capture the image with
the tree which is analyzed by the central system and classified by risk level
and a notification is sent to the maintenance team.
