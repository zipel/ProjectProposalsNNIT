# PFA Pension

## Background
PFA Pension was founded in 1917 as an independent company by a number of labour
organisations, with the sole purpose of ensuring a financially secure future
for the employees and their families. Today, PFA has approximately 1.2 million
individual customers from a wide range of the largest companies and
organisations in Denmark. And the ambition hasn’t changed – our focus has
always been, and still is, to create maximum value for our customers.

## Project Idea(s)

### 1. Life Style Insurance
PFA wants to extend their linking of real life
habits and environment to the insurance rate, price and benefits by using
connected end-user devices. For example, smartwatch data could change the
life insurance rate based on the health of the insurer (such as information on
heart rate or number to sport activities).

#### 1.1 Use Case (Dentist Insurance)
The customer is provided with a
connected toothbrush. The toothbrush has the capability to be connected to a
smartphone reporting the frequency of teeth brushing. The information is
sent to the insurance company for evaluation on the final insurance price.
