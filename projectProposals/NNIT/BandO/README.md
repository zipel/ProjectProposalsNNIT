### 1. Smart Entertainment
B&O wants extend the linking of their products to user habits and their environment.
For example:  Connected smart watches to television and speakers. Integrated home security,
everyday habits and entertainment to B&O devices. 

#### 1.1 Use Case
B&O has just finished to build an intelligent entertainment portal which is
capable to suggest automatically customers preferred music or showing customers
preferred film. The system should understand the number of people in a room and
make a choice on the average entertainment preferences. In the case only the
owner is present, the suggestion will be taken based on the customers mood
which is calculated with a connected smart watch by combining historical
activity level, hearth rate, galvanic sensor and social interaction within the
past 24h.

#### 1.2 Scenario
Only the owner in the room- his mood is happy and relaxed– B&O speaker suggest
to play relax music.
