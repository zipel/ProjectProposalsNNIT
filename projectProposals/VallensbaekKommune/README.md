# Vallensbæk Kommune

## Background

Vallensbæk is a small Municipality  on the east coast of
the island of Zealand (Sjælland) in eastern Denmark, with about 15.000 citizens - and a visionary "smart city" strategy. Vallensbæk would like to be among first movers in using technology in creating value for citizens and improving livability in the Vallenbæk area.

## Project Idea(s)

### 1. Noise Reduction
Crowdsourced noise measurements through mobile app, making it possible to
engage active citizens with an interest in noise reduction initiatives in their
local community. Bonus assignment: Enable an option to create higher quality
data by allowing the app user to calibrate app data with stationary noise
sensors installed by the municipality.

#### Technology
- Android/iOS programming
- Signal processing
- Data analytics, machine learning

#### Papers

### 2 Library Development

Vallenbæk has very recently renovated the town hall's ground floor including the old library. The newly renovated area has been transformed into Vallensbæk Culture and Citizen House. The facilities includes meeting rooms is all sizes, a lounge area, a large hall (used for city council meetings) as well as a library. The facilities are open to public - also outside town hall opening hours. 

The idea is to track users (anynomous phone IDs) of the Culture and Citizen House including the Library in order to identify which part of the area are used and which are not - as such assisting further planning in creating the best possible citizen service. Bonus assignment is to create app which makes use of the location data in case users agree to download app/sign up. One idea is to create a simple location based digital library assistant. Another idea is to create a small game which take young users into every corner of the library making them familiar with all library facilities and services.

#### Technology
- Localization
- Occupancy Monitoring
- Android/iOS programming

### 3 Green City

A very significant part of Vallensbæk Municipality are green areas, and Vallensbæk is looking for innovative solutions to assist the city's staff in keeping the city green. One example are sensors creating alarms if trees suffer from too much salt, draught etc. Another example could involve measurements or data collections in connection with bio diversity in select green areas etc. 

#### Technology
- Embedded programming
- LoRA/SigFox
- maybe Android/iOS programming
