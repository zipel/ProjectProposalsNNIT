# Water Monitoring

## Background
Water in its many forms, whether lake,river or ocean, or artificial container, in agriculture or aquaponics, is a valuable resource 
and under threat from many external sources.
Monitoring its quality and properties is thus a relevant activity in many areas.
Some base properties, such as temperature or pH value, are relatively easy to measure, yet significant nonetheless.
Advanced properties of interest include concentrations of nutrients, chemicals, heavy metals -
and for many of these no affordbale real-time methods are currently available.

As inspiration, a proposed project in Kenya:

## Project Idea(s)

To create a cost- and energy-efficient modular sensor node for water properties,
starting with well-known properties and extending to more experimental ones.
This might involve visual data - looking at water by means of image analysis, possibly incorporating absorption spectra, or similar.

An important aspect is product design - can something be created that is usable for non-technical users,
and durable enough survive under rough conditions?
Both user interfaces and physical design are thus essential parts of this project.


## Technology
This project will involve

- sensors (such as temperature, pH, DO, conductivity, chemical, ..)
- arduino, micropyhton boards
- autonomous energy, e.g. photvoltaics, batteries, hydro, with many other options
- networks, such as WiFi, LoRaWan, mobile
